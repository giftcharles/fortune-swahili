    "common_meaning": "\"Ubani\"       (Frankincense gum) is a very common\nincense in East Africa and Arabia. It is commonly\nused in large gatherings especially in religious       (Islamic)\nocassions where believers say prayers. It is very common to\nburn \"ubani\" in a small earthen container called \"kiotezo\"       filled\nwith hot charcoal. Burning \"ubani\" is customarily taken to be an essential part of\nsaying prayers. The custom is\nthought to have been brought to East Africa by the Persians (Iranians).\nAssociating a lover with a word \"ubani\" is likely due to its       nice\nfragrance or the fact that it requires a hard task of burning \"ubani\"\nin a prayer to have a lover. Statements like, \"Humpati hata kwa ubani\",\n(You will never win her even if you burn \"ubani\") are common in\nSwahili.",
